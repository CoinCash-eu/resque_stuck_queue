## TODOS

add a 'resque_stuck_queue/tasks' bit? See tres eg
add a trap{} to force_stop. ok for overwriting process's trap handlers? use config for that?

fix skeleton recipe https://github.com/shaiguitar/resque_stuck_queue/blame/master/README.md#L103
  raise appname, => :environment, log path

investigate: why is temple getting triggered? how often? is the enqueing/checking taking too much time?
also, if one queue is bad, does it trigger other queue's handlers? write some tests, asshole.
woes of redis namespace, in regards to Awsm.redis != Resque.redis etc. (which is important for setting the key through @redis)

with lag time, it will continue to trigger, for every heartbeat time it's supposed to tick, find some way to do that, and then maybe add some resolved handler/proc?

rm redis locking (since it works by keys now, no need for it, recover/trigger ping pong).
